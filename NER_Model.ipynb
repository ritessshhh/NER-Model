        "The most important question to ask at this point is about the features. *What are the type of features likely to be important in the identification of various kinds of named entities?*\n",
        "\n",
        "Unsurprisingly, the token itself and its part of speech are the most important indicators. For example, a conjunction is probably not the name of a person; an adjective is probably not a part of the name of a place (assuming that the greatness of \"Great Britain\" or the length of \"Long Island\" are correctly tagged as nouns). A few other features that research in NER detection has found to be helpful are the orthographic properties of a token, which involve the patterns of capitalization (e.g., is the word in all capital letters? is it starting with a capital letter?), the POS tags of surroundings tokens, the surrounding tokens themselves, and the orthographic properties of the surrounding tokens.\n",
        "\n",
        "You are by no means restricted to use only these properties. They are provided to you as a minimal set to explore (i.e., a starting point from where you can/should explore incorporating better features).\n",
        "\n",
        "This work is what people often call **feature engineering**. It is, in some ways, \"old school\" NLP. Nevertheless, it is a relatively recent phase of NLP research, and going through this help you gain hands-on knowledge of various programming tools/approaches in NLP. It will (hopefully) also help you appreciate the complexity and utility of neural networks where such feature engineering is rarely needed.\n",
        "\n",
        "It is, of course, important to represent the training, development, and test instances using the same set of features. And for the supervised classification, we want to store the training, development, and test sets are data frames (essentially, vectors with class labels). Your next task is to complete the following method to do this.\n",
